A simple pokemon randomizer to display it on your stream

This project can be used by anyone who want to implemant it or upgrade it.

For now it's a local project there is few evolution that can be made : 
  - The guessing game by modified the pokemon color and then make it in clear
  - The selection of a pokemon by not using a random only
  - The creation of an online solution (once i had the time in another life)
