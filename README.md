# RandomPokePicker
A simple pokemon randomizer to display it on your stream
It will use a Websocket host locally and the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get the sprite of the pokemon

In order to use it just run the server2 and open a tab in your browser with this URL : (http://localhost:8080/request-pokemon)
To select a pokemon to display just write "?pokemon_id:XX" where XX is your pokemon ID


This project can be used by anyone who want to implemant it or upgrade it.

For now it's a local project there is few evolution that can be made: 
  - The guessing game by modified the pokemon color and then make it in clear
  ~~- The selection of a pokemon by not using a random only~~
  - The creation of an online solution (as soon as I have time, in another life)
